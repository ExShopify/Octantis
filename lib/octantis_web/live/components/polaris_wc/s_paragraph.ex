defmodule OctantisWeb.Components.PolarisWC.SParagraph do
  @moduledoc """
    Displays a block of text and can contain inline elements such as buttons, links, or emphasized text. Use to present standalone blocks of content as opposed to inline text.

  ## Useful for

  * Displaying text content in a paragraph format.
  * Grouping elements with the same style. For instance, icons inside a paragraph will automatically adopt the paragraph's tone.

  ## Best practices

  * Use short paragraphs to make your content scannable.
  * Use plain and clear terms.
  * Don't use jargon or technical language.
  * Don't use different terms to describe the same thing.
  * Don't duplicate content.

  ## Example

    ```elixir
    <.s_paragraph>
      Shopify POS is the easiest way to sell your products in person. Available for
      iPad, iPhone, and Android.
    </.s_paragraph>
    ```
