defmodule OctantisWeb.Components.PolarisWC.SText do
  @moduledoc """
  Displays inline text with specific visual styles or tones. Use to emphasize or differentiate words or phrases within a Paragraph or other block-level components.

  ## Useful for

  - Adding inline text elements such as labels or line errors.
  - Applying different visual tones and text styles to specific words or phrases within a `s-paragraph`, such as a `strong` type or `critical` tone.

  ## Best practices

  - Use plain and clear terms.
  - Don't use jargon or technical language.
  - Don't use different terms to describe the same thing.
  - Don't duplicate content.

  ## Example

  ```elixir
    <.s_text type="strong">Name:</.s_text>
    <.s_text>Jane Doe</.s_text>
  ```
